## ðŸŽ¥ A Brief History of Movies

The history of cinematography dates back to the late 19th century, when the first motion pictures were created. What started as short silent films evolved into the narrative-driven, sound-infused, and visually stunning films we know today. From the silent film era of **Charlie Chaplin**, to the Golden Age of Hollywood with stars like **Humphrey Bogart** and **Audrey Hepburn**, movies have transformed to reflect society and push creative boundaries. Today, cinema continues to be a powerful medium for storytelling, innovation, and cultural expression.
